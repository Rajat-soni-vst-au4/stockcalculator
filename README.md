# stockcalculator

As the name stockcalculator, it will be used by the seller to keep a track of inventory(stock).

As the data has to be added from the input and it will display on UI (name, description, price and quantity.) As same the UI, the data shall uploded on the server(API) using postman/axios.

Addtionally, every element of data list on UI has 3 buttons. as soon as we click on button-1, it will decrease the quantity by 1 on the UI as well as on the server. The same will work for the other buttons.

I have tried and make this functionalities work. Please use your own API from crudcurd.com to experiment my code.

Thank you.
